// Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

// Example
// ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'
// words = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']
// smash(words) # returns "hello world this is great"
// Assumptions
// You can assume that you are only given words.
// You cannot assume the size of the array.
// You can assume that you do get an array.

function smash (words) {
  
    let str = ''
    
    for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++){
      let hold = words[i]
      str += `${hold} `      
      }
      return str.slice(0, -1)
};

//BEST SOLUTION
function smash (words) {

  return words.join(' ') 
   
};

// .join(' ') does not add spaces at the beginning or the end of the string—only between the words—so the function correctly meets the requirement.
