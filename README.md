Here are all the codewars problems and solutions I've been working on! They also include more than one solution to see how problems can be solved with and without methods and to compare which solutions are more efficient. My goal is continue to improve and work on at least one codewars problem per day to become more comfortable with javascript and strenghthen my problem-solving skills!
